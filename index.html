        <p class="lead">As data science continues to grow as an integral part of life in the 21 st century,
          its applications around the world continue to diversify and change the status quo. Our mission is
          to harness the powerful applications of machine learning and predictive analytics to make a positive
          impact on medicine in developing nations. Through the training of medical professionals on the
          fundamentals of data science as well as assisting in the creation of advanced analytics pipelines
          via machine learning, we hope to make groundbreaking strides in integrating AI in medicine in developing nations.

                 presentations to hospitals (including Georgetown Public Hospital
                 Corp, Balwant Singh Hospital, and Hanoman Medical Center),
                 universities, and government members (received commendation
                 from Guyana Ministry of Health/NCI) about how predictive analytics
                 can start to be implemented/the advantages of predictive
                 analysis/machine learning when applied to medicine, especially
                 disease diagnosis via clinical data sets. For this initiative,
                 he was commended by the nation’s Ministry of Health and National
                 Cancer Institute as they saw the potential that such a program could have.

              <p>In the summer of 2016 Project DataREACH expanded with a project
                in Cameroon thanks to a collaboration with Songhai Labs, which
                is global Knowledge Broker Platform for the African Continent with
                the ambition to positively transform African societies by sharing
                knowledge and innovations across countries and across sectors. We
                are currently working on a proposal to obtain some data from
                medical entities in Cameroon to begin looking into ways in which
                machine learning pipelines can usefully be created. We are also
                planning remote basic training sessions to enable motivated medical
                professionals in Cameroon to apply data science techniques to
                data they have access to and begin discussion of how these
                skills will impact the nation long term.
